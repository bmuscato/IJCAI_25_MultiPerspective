Perspectives in Play: Integrating Minority Voices with a Multi-Perspective Lens

Abstract

 In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for handling human disagreement include averaging annotators' viewpoints or using majority voting, both of which strive to establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding individual opinions can lead to the side-effect of under-representing minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals, this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to encourage the development of the next generation of perspective-aware modelsâ€”more responsible, inclusive, and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse subjective text classification tasks including  hate speech, irony, abusive language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods.
Results show that the multi-perspective approach achieves superior classification performance (higher F1-scores), outperforming the traditional approaches that rely on a single ground-truth. Additionally, we assessed the models' ability to approximate human label distributions using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) as soft metric of reference. Notably, the multi-perspective models outperformed both baseline models across diverse subjective tasks. However, it exhibits lower model confidence in tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity present in the texts. Lastly, we exploit model uncertainty using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.
